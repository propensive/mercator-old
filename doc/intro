Mercator is a macro for automatically constructing evidence that a known type
may be used in a for-comprehension, for abstracting over monad-like types with
no impact on performance.

This allows us to write code against generic type constructors which can assume
that they are usable in a for-comprehension, without having the evidence that
they are until the application point when the type constructor is known, at
which point, Mercator will construct it.
